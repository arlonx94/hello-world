Hello, fellow developers!

Arlonx94 here. I want to use this site with the other information that other programmers develop to better my proficiency with code. I'm a low-level beginner and only have experience thus far with HTML and CSS. I have just started working a little in SCSS and JS, but I'm barely scratching the surface with these.
